### Hi there üëã

I am a PhD Candidate in political science whose current dissertation work and research interests focus on making causal inferences from peacebuilding programs, such as foreign aid packages, mediated peace agreements, and peacekeeping operations. My GitHub account details my progress on these projects along with other side projects and a collection of writings (some are still in progress) on a variety of topics.

**Working Projects**

- ‚òÆÔ∏è [Do UN Peacekeeping Operations Lead to Peace?](https://github.com/Brian-Lookabaugh/Causal-Impact-of-PKOs-on-Peace)

**Blog Posts**

- [Executing SQL in R](https://github.com/Brian-Lookabaugh/Executing-SQL-in-R)
